**Summary & Next Steps:**

- **v18.0.0 Release Complete.** The Optimization Core is stable. The `StrategicExecutor` and `AgentCore` have been successfully upgraded with new efficiency and accuracy features. The `KnowledgeBase` now supports perceptual filtering.
- **Next Task:** **Project Conclusion.** The MARK-I project has successfully achieved its ultimate architectural vision and has now been optimized for performance. It stands as a complete conceptual model for a next-generation AI assistant.
