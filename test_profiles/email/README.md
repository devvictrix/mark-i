# Email Automation Profiles

Email automation profiles for sending, reading, and managing emails

## Profile Organization

- Each profile is stored as a JSON file with a descriptive name
- Profile files contain complete automation definitions including regions, rules, and actions
- Use the Profile Manager UI to create, edit, and manage profiles in this category

## Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the profile's purpose
- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `send-email-template.json`)
- Include version numbers for major changes (e.g., `web-search-v2.json`)

## Best Practices

- Test profiles thoroughly before deploying them for regular use
- Document complex profiles with detailed descriptions
- Use templates as starting points for similar automation tasks
- Keep profiles focused on specific, well-defined tasks
